# Introduction

I have done research on UI packages for React Native and here are my findings for the top UI packages in no particular order. (P.S. They are all free)

# Option 1

# Option 6

# Notes

These are all very good UI packages and there is no wrong choice here, it all balls down to personal style and preferences.  
Although, I did discover that a lot of people prefered to use Option 6 more often and it is the only option that has a table component included. Although this component might not get used, it would be best to have it available if needed. Since it is also a fan favourite, we would be better off using it too.

# Package Safety

React Native Paper has been scanned for known vulnerabilities and missing license, and no issues were found. It has been deemed safe for use [here](https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/react-native-paper)
