# Survey

## After making use of the UI prototype, how would you describe your overall experience?
70% of the people who participated in the survey said it was "Good".  
The remaining 30% said it was "Very Good".

## What did you find most pleasing about the interface and why do you find it very pleasing?
Ten responses were recorded, they are as follows:
- Navigation and flow was smooth
- The color patterns
- the color and font
- Love the contrast of the colour
- Logo transition on the landing view
- Button placements are simple and the appâ€™s overall layout is visually appealing
- I liked the appearance of the app
- The transition is smooth
- the colors were nice
- i found the wallet interesting i found the wallet pleasing because if i forget my actual wallet at home then i have it on my phone so that will come in handy.

## What did you find displeasing about the interface and why?  

Eight responses were recorded, they are as follows:
- Multiple clicks but not a major concern
- Nothing was outright displeasing about the interface
- There were limitations to the app. I understand this is due to the fact the app is still in progress but i could only enter 3 options and there was no much information regarding the UI. It was just a Hi user so it was a little bit underwhemling. As i said earlier, i understand its still a work in progress and i canâ€™t wait to see how it turns out
- I didnâ€™t find anything displeasing
- Tbh it looked nice and good but nothing was really working. I didnâ€™t reply understand the use of the app
- I can't enter any info yetðŸ˜…
- nothing in particular mostly the links / features that weren't yet implemented
- i found everything to be alright nothing displeasing so far  

## What opinions do you have about the current color scheme of the interface? Did you feel a sense of calmness while using it or did the colors throw you off?  
Ten responses were recorded, they are as follows: 
- Colours look neutral
- Yea the color scheme was really nice actually itâ€™s pretty calming
- the color is perfect!
- I actually love it. As i said, it was the major thing that caught my attentIon.
- The background colour gives the calm effect, but are contrasted heavily by the font colour/ weight. The interface could use some white background and theme colours on select elements.
- The colour theme could be improved. I think a purple & white interface would be much better than a purple & orange-ish. But thatâ€™s just subjective
- I feel the colour scheme is ok. It makes it more user friendly and convenient
- It was good, it was nice and not too much at all
- I liked the purple on purple scheme
- i felt a sense of calmness but i think skyblue would be better in my opinion

## How do you feel about the font used in the interface?
Ten responses were recorded, they are as follows: 
- Maybe could be improved here with another font option just to see the difference
- Gives it all a casual app vibe if thatâ€™s makes sense, itâ€™s pretty fitting for a wellness app in my opinion
- Font is okay
- I actually like it alot especially on the drop downs.
- I like the sans serif font choice. 'Hi User' could use some less weight and do away with the text shadows.
- It was very appropriate and user-friendly
- Itâ€™s very nice and makes one feel more comfortable with the app
- Great, perfect size
- I could read everything it looked good
- the font was good ngl (ngl = not gonna lie)

## Do you think the buttons are well placed and easy to see/notice? If No, please tell us what buttons gave you a hard time.
Ten responses were recorded, they are as follows: 
- Buttons are well placed but my opinion is subjective
- The get started button was a bit low, I almost didnâ€™t see it at the bottom of the start page
- Yes!
- As i said earlier, i could only use 3 buttons but it looks good so far
- Was unintuitive to scroll to find the main navigation on logging in ('Hi User' page). A sticky nav might be a good idea in this situation
- Yes. That was the best part to me
- The buttons are well spaced and everything. Could be properly seen
- They are good where they are
- they looked good i'm accustomed to android having buttons at the very bottom of the screen will this app disable those?
- the buttons were well placed but i had a hard time opening up the wallet

## Did you ever feel lost while using the interface? If Yes, please tell us where and describe what happened
- Yes. There were some buttons that werenâ€™t exactly responding when I tapped. It just kept highlighting other buttons
- Sign In/Up links were a little difficult to find on the form page - Sign in link on sign up form; sign up link on sign in form

## Is there anything you think is missing from this brief prototype demo?
- All well situated
- Not really
- Maybe a hand sign for by the "Hi User! "
- Donâ€™t know what the idea behind the website is so I canâ€™t really say tbh but goodluck with this bro
- The pages from the main navigation could use some transition/animation. The transition to the other pages felt crude
- The main form container could do without the border. Logo takes up too much space on the form pages.
- Good work overall!
- I think it served its purpose as a UI demonstration so no
- I think there should be an introduction so the user can understand what the app is about in general
- Nothing I can think off
- No nothing
