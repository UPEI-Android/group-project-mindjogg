# Emergency Support Services: Find Them

After searching the internet, I was able to find a couple of services we can provide/link to users of Mindjogg.

### Service 1

Name: The Island Helpline  
Type: Crisis Lines/Mental Health Awareness  
Phone: 1-800-218-2885  
Description:  
The Island Helpline provides free, confidential emotional support and crisis intervention to Islanders of all ages. Our trained and caring staff and volunteers are here to answer your call any time of the day or night – 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  
The Island Helpline plays an important role in our communities. We help callers by providing a listening ear, emotional support, crisis intervention and links to community resources available on PEI.  
We do not judge. You can express your thoughts and feelings in confidence regardless of whether you are grieving, feeling sad, anxious, overwhelmed, or in crisis. Your well-being is important to us and we are here for you through life’s challenges.  
All of our volunteers and staff are trained in Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST). This training allows them to discuss suicide with callers in an open, direct and non-judgmental manner. It also provides us with the skills to identify risk and to work with callers to develop safe plans to guard against that risk.

### Service 2

Name: Social Assistance Program  
Type: Financial Assistance  
Phone: 1-877-569-0546  
Description:  
The Social Assistance Program helps you meet your basic needs when you cannot. The program provides help on a case-by-case basis to people who meet the requirements.
Social Assistance will assist you in paying for:

- Food
- Shelter
- Medications
- Basic Dental
- Glasses
- Funeral costs

The amount of money you can get depends on how much money you make, how many children you have and if you own your own home or rent.

### Service 3

Name: AccessAbility Supports  
Type: Financial Assistance (Disability)  
Phone: (902) 620-3777, 1-866-594-3777  
Email: deptsdh@gov.pe.ca  
Description:  
Our government wants to ensure Islanders living with disabilities can access the tools they need to reach their full potential and contribute to society as fully as possible. These improvements mean supports will be more personalized and focus on empowering individuals and their families.

Supports include:

- Life skills training in areas like meal preparation, budgeting, grocery shopping, recreational activities;
- Technical aids and assistive devices such as a wheelchair; and
- Supports that enable an individual to be self-sufficient and live independently such as in-home supports or personal care workers.
- Financial assistance for a caregiver to provide daily supervision and guidance in a community-based residential setting; and
- Financial help for required home and vehicle modifications – $10,000 every 10 years for home modifications and $6,000 every eight years for a vehicle.
- Assistance with finding or keeping a job including coaching, skills training, and supports for youth transitioning from the education system to the workforce; and
- Supports to enable active participation in the community such as day programming, personal aid or specialized transportation.
- Respite for caregivers to allow for time for breaks to recharge; and
- Support to provide supervision for adults who are unable to stay home alone safely so that caregivers can go to work or school.
- Assistance for basic needs such as food, clothing, shelter, household and personal supplies through what is called Assured Income.
