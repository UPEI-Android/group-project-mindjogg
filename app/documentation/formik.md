# Formik

Making and managing our own forms will be a hectic procedure so it would be best later down in production to make use of an npm package to  
handle the forms (Similar to Material-UI). Andrew suggested using a package called Formly but upon further research, I found out that formly  
may not be available to use on React Native (it seems to be only available to React.js). So I went searching for an alternative and I have come across one called Formik, it is similar to Formly in function and would be a great replacement.

# Getting Started

First of you are going to want to install the package using npm and include it to your package.json file (npm install formik --save)

Next, you are going to take a look at the documentation which is very well organized, even has some videos with it. You can check it out here [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview)
